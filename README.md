# 📚 Interactive Worksheet Web App

This project is a web-based interactive worksheet designed to support student learning with visually guided instructions, dynamic content, and self-checking features. It is compatible with [Liveworksheets.com](https://www.liveworksheets.com/) and can be used either as a standalone activity or embedded within the Liveworksheets platform.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Collapsible instruction panel (with images and styled text)
- ✅ Input fields for answers and auto-checking
- ✅ Custom layout and background colors
- ✅ Designed for integration with Liveworksheets
- ✅ Lightweight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend

## 🌐 Third-Party Integration

This project uses [**Liveworksheets**](https://www.liveworksheets.com/) as a **third-party platform** for worksheet deployment and grading support. Some layout and behavior (e.g., form inputs and answer checking) are **controlled automatically by Liveworksheets**, which may override parts of the custom design.

💡 **Note:** The layout inside Liveworksheets may appear slightly different than in a standalone browser due to its internal rendering rules.
